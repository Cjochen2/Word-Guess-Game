# Word-Guess-Game

This is a basic Word Guessing Game. The game starts by hitting any key and will log your wins. The category was 90's music and has about 15 different songs that are randomnly chosen. You guess by typing a letter and if your guess is correct it gets logged. If it is wrong a guess is subtracted and is logged in the guessed letter section. Once you guess the word you hit a key to reset the game and start again.

The only feature I still want to put into it is the ability to play the song after it has been guessed. I just haven't gotten to it yet due to the busy schedule.
